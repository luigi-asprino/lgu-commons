ukb needs boost version 1.48 or higher to compile. Specifically, UKB needs the
following Boost libraries:

      * boost graph library
      * boost program options 
      * boost filesystem
      * boost tokenizer
      * boost lexical cast
      * boost numeric conversions
      * boost asio
      * boost random

* Compiling boost

If you have a linux distribution, just install the packages for boost
development. However, if you want to compile the boost libraries yourself, there
are some steps you can follow. This would install boost version 1.54. The files
will be installed into the /usr/local directory:

$ mkdir /tmp/boost_src
$ cd /tmp/boost_src
$ wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/boost/boost/1.54.0/boost_1_54_0.tar.bz2
$ tar xjf boost_1_54_0.tar.bz2
$ cd boost_1_54_0
$ ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=graph,system,filesystem,program_options,regex,random
$ sudo ./b2 install --layout=system
$ sudo ldconfig
$ cd
$ sudo rm -fr /tmp/boost_src

* Compiling UKB

If you have installed boost following the reciple above, just do the following:

$ cd src
$ ./configure --with-boost-include=/usr/local/include
$ make

the ./configure script has some options (./configure --help to see them
 all). The important options are:

  --prefix

  path were the executables will be installed (after 'make install')

  --with-boost-include

  path were the Boost include files reside (default is /usr/include)

  --with-boost-lib

  path were the Boost library files reside (default is /usr/lib)

  --enable-static

   Enable static linkage. The binary files that come with the ukb
   distribution are compiled using this directive. Note that, if static
   linking is enabled, ukb server can not be compiled (you have to run make
   with the "UKB_NO_SERVER=1" parameter.

After ./configure, just do a typical 'make'. 

% make

If you want UKB to be compiled without server support, jun run make this
way:

% make "UKB_NO_SERVER=1"
