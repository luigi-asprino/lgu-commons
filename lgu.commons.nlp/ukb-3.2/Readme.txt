UKB: Graph Based Word Sense Disambiguation and Similarity

UKB is a collection of programs for performing graph-based Word Sense
Disambiguation and lexical similarity/relatedness using a pre-existing
knowledge base.

UKB has been developed by the IXA group in the University of the Basque
Country. UKB applies the so-called Personalized PageRank on a Lexical
Knowledge Base (LKB) to rank the vertices of the LKB and thus perform
disambiguation. The details of the method are described in [1]. It has also
been applied on WSD on specific domains [2,5] and Named Entity
Disambiguation [6]. The algorithm can also be used to calculate lexical
similarity/relatedness of words/sentences. See [3,4,6] for applications of
UKB to similarity.

Replicating UKB results
***********************

The "wsdeval/" directory contains the scripts to reproduce UKB results
evaluated in the WSD Evaluation Framework dataset. See "wsdeval/README" and
follow the instructions.
