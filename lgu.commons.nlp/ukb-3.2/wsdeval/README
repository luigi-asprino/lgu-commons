This folder contains the scripts for running UKB over the WSD eval dataset
([1]).


Requisites
==========

You will need the following packages installed:

- Java compiler (javac)
- perl XML::LibXML library

If you downloaded the source from github you'll need to compile UKB (see
instructions in "src/INSTALL").

Besides, you need to edit "download_and_prepare_data.sh" (line 5) and
"run_experiments.sh" (line 9), and fill the appropriate path for UKB
binaries.

Summary
=======

To reproduce the experiments, run the following scripts:

./download_and_prepare_data.sh
./run_experiments.sh
./evaluate.sh

If you want to run additional experiments (using different algorithms and
parameters), give a parameter to "./run_experiments.sh", for example:

./run_experiments.sh all

Find below the expected output of the process.

More detailed explanation
=========================

The "./download_and_prepare_data.sh" script prepares all the required data:
WordNet related files (graph, dictionary, etc) in folder "wn30/" and the
files of WSD Eval feramework into "wsdeval_src/". After the script has
finished, these are the important files used in subsequent processes (you
can safely remove the rest):

   wn30/wn30g.bin      Compiled graph of WN3.0 + gloss relations
   wn30/wn30_dict.txt  WN3.0 dictionary
   wn30/id2lc.map      Mapping between WN database ids and lexicographic codes
   wsdeval_src/		   The WSD Unified Evaluation Datasets

The "./run_experiments.sh" runs UKB in various configurations and leave the
results into the "Key/raw" folder.

The "./evaluate.sh" script converts ukb outputs in "Keys/raw" into a
suitable form for WSDeval, leaving the converted keyfiles in the "Keys/"
folder. Then, it runs the official scorer and report the results.

Expected output
===============

For convenience, this is the expected output of the process. Note that this
is the default configuration of UKB:

* pprw2w
	ALL P= 67.3% R= 67.3% F1= 67.3%
	semeval2007 P= 53.0% R= 53.0% F1= 53.0%
	semeval2013 P= 68.8% R= 68.8% F1= 68.8%
	semeval2015 P= 70.3% R= 70.3% F1= 70.3%
	senseval2 P= 68.8% R= 68.8% F1= 68.8%
	senseval3 P= 66.1% R= 66.1% F1= 66.1%
